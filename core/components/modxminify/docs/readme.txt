=== MODX MINIFY - MINIFY YOUR CSS, LESS, SCSS AND JS FILES ===
MODX Minify is a MODX Extra to group and minify your CSS, SCSS, LESS and JS files. You can create groups, and each group can contain multiple files of the same type. So for instance you create a group named 'CSS' where you add all your CSS, SCSS and LESS files. After that you place the snippet call [[!modxMinify?&group=`css`]] inside a <link> tag in your head. This will generate a minified CSS file containg all files from that group! More information can be found here: https://github.com/Sterc/modx-minify
